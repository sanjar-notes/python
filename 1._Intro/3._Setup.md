Created Monday 15 March 2021

#### Python Installation
**For Windows**

* Download and install executable from [www.python.org](www.python.org)
* While installing, check the "Add to environment PATH" option.


**For Linux and Mac**
Warning: Don't install/update the system(built-in) Python. It can mess up your system.

* Install pyenv.
* Then install latest version of Python3.
* All steps: <https://youtu.be/fv8YxO3AJqg>


#### Code Editor(I prefer VS Code)

* Install the official executable for Visual Studio Code.
* Install these extensions:
	* Python - by Microsoft
	* Pylance - by Microsoft
	* Visual Studio Intellicode - by Microsoft
	* Code Runner - by Jun Han
* Go to Settings → Extensions → Code Runner and enable "Run in Integrated terminal".


#### Running Python code
There are two ways to run python code:

1. REPL - open terminal, write ``python3``, press Enter. You can now run Python. Good for experimenting.
2. Run code from file(s), for more "persistent" work.
