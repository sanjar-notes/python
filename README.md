These are extensive Python3 notes that I created when learning Python(in an organized way this time 🙃️).

It contains almost all of the usual stuff in Python3. I know C++ and have shortened some topics where Python3 and C++ are equivalent.

It does not cover things like meta-classes or decorators, yet.

To use the notes, just install [zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/index.html) and open `notebook.zim` with it.

You are good to go!
