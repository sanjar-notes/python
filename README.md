# What

These are extensive notes that I made while learning Python3(in an organized way this time 🙃️).

It contains almost all of the usual stuff. I know C++ and have shortened some topics where Python3 and C++ are equivalent.

It does not cover things like meta-classes or decorators, yet.

# How
You can skim through the notes if you like: most files are plain text.

To use the notes properly, install [zim-wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/index.html) and open `notebook.zim` with it.
