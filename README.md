# Why 
Frustrated by C++'s slow prototyping

Happened to require it for ML

But then my college was stupid, so a [bot](https://github.com/dormant-sanjarcode/attend_lecture_bot)

# How
Just do it!

# What

These are extensive notes that I made while learning Python3(in an organized way this time 🙃️).

It contains almost all of the usual stuff. I know C++ and have shortened some topics where Python3 and C++ are equivalent.

It does not cover things like meta-classes or decorators, yet.

# Using this
Clone or just skim it, it's Markdown 🙌.
