Created Thursday 14 May 2020

We'll look at a problem  where we can increase the performance.
[../shelf_challenge_2.py](shelf_challenge_2.py)
[../sc_cave_intilaize.py](sc_cave_intilaize.py)
[../sc_2_cave_game.py](sc_2_cave_game.py)

Conclusions: 

* It is very easy to change all dicts to persistent ones. We can now work with real world data.
* Get the data correct first, not changing the code.
