# 4. Loops
Created Wednesday 03 February 2021

#### **Loops**

* **for **- used for both ranges and iterables
	* **range**(a, b, step) similar to (i = a; i < b; i++) a = 0, step = 1 is the default 
	* iterables - for item in [1,2,3]
* **while** - standard
* **do while** - standard


#### Loop controls

* **continue** - goes to the next iteration without executing anything after continue.
* **break **- terminates the current loop. Current - nearest parent.


#### **Alternative uses of ``else``**
**mAid** - runs if no explicit flow change is executed.

* In **for **loop - executed only if loop runs successfully. It is kind of a misnomer. Helps in avoiding flag variables.

	for i in range(10):
		a = i
	else
		print("Loop Ran Okay")


* In **while** loop - runs if no breaks are executed.
* In error handling - when no error occurs.
