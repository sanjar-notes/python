# 1. Basic constructs
Created Friday 15 May 2020


1. ``type``(variable) returns the type of the variable.
2. C++ and Python3 follow the same variable naming rules.
3. string_name.replace(catch, rep) replaces all occurrences of catch with rep in the string.
4. If place-holders are sequential, we can write them as {}, no need of indices.
5. listObj.insert(pos, value) inserts the value in the list, there's nothing like push().
6. Short hand if

	if 2 > 1: print("a is greater than b") # if single line


7. ternary operator - follows English

	print("A") if 2 > 1 else print("B")
	# notice the order, work1 condition else work2 - like english


8. use pass for empty if statements - they just syntactical, and have no effect whatsover on execution.
9. chr(65) gets us the character for ASCII code and ord('A') gets us the ascii ordinate for a character(passed as string)
10. Falsy values - There are 10
