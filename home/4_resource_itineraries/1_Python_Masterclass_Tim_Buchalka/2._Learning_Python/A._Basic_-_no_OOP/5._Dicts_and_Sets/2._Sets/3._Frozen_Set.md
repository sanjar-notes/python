# 3. Frozen Set
Created Wednesday 13 May 2020

It is a set which is immutable. i.e it can be used as a key.

* This helps us to make dicts in dicts.
* It is like a tuple, but we can do set ops. Except update.

	frs = frozenset(iterable_name) # only primitives allowed


* Python is **super** powerful.
