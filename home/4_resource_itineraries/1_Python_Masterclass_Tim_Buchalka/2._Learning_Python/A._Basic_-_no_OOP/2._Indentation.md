# 2. Indentation
Created Tuesday 19 May 2020


* Python is stricly indented and does not use {} as code-blocks.
* Semicolons are not required.
* Semicolons can be used to write multiple statements in one line. This is frowned upon, because it hampers readablity. This is purely cosmetic and doesn't change execution procedure.
* Blocks statements have the same indentation, continually. A block in python is called a 'suite'.
