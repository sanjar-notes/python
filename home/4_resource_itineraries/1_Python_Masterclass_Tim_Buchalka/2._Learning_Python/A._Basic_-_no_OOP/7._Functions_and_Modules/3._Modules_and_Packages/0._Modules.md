# 0. Modules
Created Wednesday 06 January 2021

There are several advantages of ``modul``~~``e``~~arizing code in a large application:

* Separation of concerns (SoC) - easy debugging, testing, participative, low impact of change, low coupling.
* Reusability - less duplicate code
* Scoping - Eliminates naming collisions, i.e modules may have variables with the same name.


There three kinds of modules, but they are all treated the same:

1. Python file.
2. C/C++ file, e.g the re(regex) module
3. A built-in module, like ``itertools``, that is contained intrinsically in the interpreter.
