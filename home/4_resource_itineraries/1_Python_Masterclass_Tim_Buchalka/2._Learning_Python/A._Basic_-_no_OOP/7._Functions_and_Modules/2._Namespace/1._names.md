# 1. names
Created Wednesday 06 January 2021


* Name (also called identifier) is simply a name given to objects by the programmer. Everything in Python is an object. Name is a way to access the underlying object.
* All names have an underlying ``id`` which can be accessed using ``id``(var_name) method. This is an integer which is guaranteed to be unique. Two objects with non-overlapping lifetimes may have the same id() value.
