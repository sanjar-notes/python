# 2. Alternative syntax for properties
Created Thursday 28 May 2020


* This is more common.
* It uses 'decorators'
* Does exactly the same thing.
* Only syntax differs.
* Decorators let us omit writing the property line. It is preferable.


Syntax:
	@property
	def attribute_name(self):	# getter is done
		return self._score
	
	@property.setter			# setter is done
	def attribute_name(self, score):
		self._score =  score
	# we still need to keep the names different, obviously



* We'll cover decorators afterwards.
