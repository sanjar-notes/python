# 10. Challenge
Created Wednesday 27 May 2020


* **Modify** the Player class so that the playersâ€™ scores are increased by one thousand every time their level increases by one.
* So if they jump up two levels, they'll get a bonus of two thousand added to their score.
* If the player drops back a level, they'll lose one thousand for each level they drop

back.

* They can't go below Level One, so your solution should prevent that from

happening.

* The aim of this challenge is to practice properties, so although it may make more

sense to add methods to increase and decrease the level, please don't do it that

way - use a property.
