====== 5. Non Public and Mangling ======
Created Friday 22 May 2020

[[./challenge/challenge.py]] - Tim's challenge
[[./challenge/my_challenge.py]] - My challenge (Works!)
--------------------

**Mangling**: Names are mangled(renamed) to **avoid clashes** with subclass attributes. [[./mangling_1_weird.py|mangling_1_wierd.py]]
* Mangling is done only for attributes of type
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
__variable_name[^__].  # two underscores at the start, not more than one at the end

# mangled to 
_ClassName__variable_name[^-].
}}}

* The attribute is still accessible both ways inside the class, but mangled outside the class. The **code file isn't changed/edited(Python handles mangling internally)**
--------------------
* **dict** is a useful variable for any object - @__dict__ can be used to access everything inside an object
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
print(tim.__dict__)	# prints all about the object as a dict
# __balance was changed to _Account__balanced outside the class
}}}

* Accessing private variables is a **bad **practice, unless you have no option.
* Mangling happens for both variables and methods.
--------------------
Being nonpublic is indicated in code, using the following conventions:
1. _name is used to indicate a protected or not to be tampered function. Used for static methods too.
2. __private_name is used to indicate a private attribute. Mangling is **discouraged**.
3. name_ is used to avoid clashes with the inbuilt functions. Still a normal method.
