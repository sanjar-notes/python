* There exists a circular relationship here, we'll deal with it.
* Our primary data is song tracks which we import in the program using albums.tsv. It contains names of all the fields in the for of a track list.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
artist_name, album_name, year_field, song_field
}}}

We have created the classes and the load_data function to get the data from albums.tsv

Approaches:
0. We'll make make the things we can't do hollow/incomplete for the time being.
1. We do it as or the given data. Our goal is to represent the objects in a stable way.
	a. We create an album object if not present in the global albums list(auxilary).
	b. Else we add the song to the album.
	c. ...
	d. We write a method to check if we've written the data correctly.
