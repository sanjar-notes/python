====== 2. Alternative syntax for properties ======
Created Thursday 28 May 2020

* This is more common.
* It uses 'decorators'
* Does exactly the same thing.
* Only syntax differs.
* Decorators let us omit writing the property line. It is preferable.

Syntax:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
@property
def attribute_name(self):	# getter is done
	return self._score

@property.setter			# setter is done
def attribute_name(self, score):
	self._score =  score
# we still need to keep the names different, obviously
}}}


* We'll cover decorators afterwards.
