====== 2. repr function ======
Created Wednesday 03 February 2021

This is also a dunder method used to specify the string equivalent of the object.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
class Car:
	# usual stuff about class
	
	# for specifying, function name surrounded by double underscores
	def __repr__(self):
		# return string equivalent
audiR8 = Car()

print(repr(audiR8)) # syntax for calling, no double underscores
}}}


=== Difference between ''__str__'' and ''__repr__'' ===
* There's [[https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/str-vs-repr-in-python/|no]] technical difference. It's just a matter of convenience, for both the user and the developer.
* The coventional purpose is:
''str'' → For readablity
''repr'' → For precision/debugging
