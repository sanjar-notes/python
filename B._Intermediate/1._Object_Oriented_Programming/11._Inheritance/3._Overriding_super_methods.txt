====== 3. Overriding super methods ======
Created Thursday 28 May 2020

* In Python 3, just write a method with the **same name** as the super class. This will override the method, irrepective of the arguments/number of arguments.
* We can either write a new  definition for the function.
* We can use this with the **super() **method on the method, to use the previous(the parent class) function and some change.
