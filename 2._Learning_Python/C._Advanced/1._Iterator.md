# 1. Iterator
Created Saturday 09 January 2021

Iterators are everywhere in Python. They are elegantly implemented within for loops, comprehensions, generators etc. but are *hidden* in plain sight.


* Iterators are objects that can be iterated upon.
* Iterators are used to 'freely' traverse iterables. 


Only [forward](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2777188/making-a-python-iterator-go-backwards) ``iterator``(s) exist in Python by default.

#### Syntax

* Get an iterator - ``iter``(myIterable) returns an ``iterator``.
* Move forward - ``next``(myIterator)

Note: after the last elements iterator, we get an error.

Examples
	string = "123456789"
	
	for char in string:
		print(char, end='')
	
	for char in iter(string):
		print(char)


	listt = ["sanjar", "maryam", 1, 2, 5, "ahmar", 7]
	
	my_iterator = iter(listt)
	
	for i in range(len(listt)):
		print(next(my_iterator))
	
	# same as
	for i in listt:
		print(i)
