====== 3. Assignment and nature of variables ======
Created Saturday 17 October 2020

=== Basic(Memory allocation) ===
* Python pools basic variables. i.e x = 2; y = 2; point to the same location. Even z = 1 + 1 points to that location. Example - int, string.
* Python does not pool non-basic types - list, dict etc.
{{./pasted_image.png}}
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
x = 2
y = 1+1
z = 2 - 0
id(x)==id(y)==id(z) # True, basic types

x = [1, 2, 3]
y = [1, 2, 3]
id(x)==id(y) # False, this is not a basic type
}}}

Note:
* Pooling is for basic types only. Consquently, operations on basic types are not in-place - they return values.
* For non basic types - change at memory location.

=== Assignment ===
1. For basic data structures - string, int, bool, float - by value.
2. All else - by reference(i.e only an alias is created).
Note:
	* Use **obj.copy()** for a deep copy.
	* use keyword '**is**' to check if variables are aliases.
	* **==** does bit by bit comparison, except for functions - where False is returned, comparison is undecidable.

=== Augmented Assignment ===
1. +, *, =, %, //, **
2. In C/C++ and Java, augmented assignment is a pure syntax sugar. But python creates a buffer variable if we use long hand assignment. Augmented is in-place and hence fast.
3. Can be used universally, i.e used for strings too.
4. Other operators are &=, ^=, |=, <<=, >>=

=== Walrus operator(assignment expressions) ===
Just like C++, C, JS we can operate on an assignent expression, which first replaces the expression with the calculated value.
* Available in Python3.8+
* Syntax - The assignment operator(=) with a colon before it. No spaces.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
(x=2)*3 # Error before Python3.8
(x:=2)*3 # x has become 2, result 6
(x:=2*x+1)*x # 25
}}}
