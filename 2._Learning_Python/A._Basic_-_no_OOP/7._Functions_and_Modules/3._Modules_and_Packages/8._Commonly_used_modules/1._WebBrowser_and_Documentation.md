# 1. WebBrowser and Documentation
Created Friday 15 May 2020

This module **webbrowser **- lets us go to some page using our default browser. It's not a browser on it's own. 
	import webbrowser
	webbrowser.open("https://www.python.org/")


We want to learn about the modules and how to use them. 
We also get help about how to(the level to which) do documentation.
The documentation provides

1. Functions
2. Variables
3. Special behavior
4. Special care for specific operating systems.
5. Exceptions
6. General guidelines for use.


*****

Reading the documentation:

1. 'if possible' is not always true. Sometimes hard settings on the PC/OS are the master key.
2. Look only for what you need.
3. Try to understand a function only if we are unable to find a simple function. 
4. Documentation can sometimes be too general, not actionable.
5. Don't worry too much about the terms, like technical details, jargon(e.g parameters vs arguments).
