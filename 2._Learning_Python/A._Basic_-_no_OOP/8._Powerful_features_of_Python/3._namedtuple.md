# 3. namedtuple
Created Tuesday 19 May 2020

#### Source
	from collections import namedtuple


#### Syntax
	tuple_name = namedtuple('Tuple_full_name', ['field_1', 'field_2', 'field_3']) # as many fields as you like
	
	Point = namedtuple('d_point', ['x', 'y', 'z']) # name needs to be a valid name
	origin = Point(0, 0, 0) # making a Point tuple
	
	# access value
	origin.x # origin['x'], origin[0] are also valid
	
	# set value - not possible - REASON: immutability of tuple
