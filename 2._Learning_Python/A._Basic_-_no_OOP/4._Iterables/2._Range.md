# 2. Range
Created Saturday 17 October 2020

**Range - **It's a bulit in type in python3.

#### Syntax for ``range``

* General form - ``range([start=0,] end [, step=1])``
* range(n) ≡ range(0, n, 1)


Note: A range with absurd parameters is empty, but this is revealed only upon iteration(or equivalent operation).

#### Features

* Creating a list/set - pass ``range`` object to ``list`` constructor
* ``len`` is valid for ``range``
* ``range`` is subscriptable. For example ``range(1, 155, 2)[3]`` is ``7``
* ``range`` is sliceable. For example ``range(1, 10)[2:4]`` is ``range(3, 5)``



#### Uses

1. Used in the ``for`` loop:

	for i in range(0, 100, 5):
		print(i)


2. Obtain all divisiors of some 'x' in the range, using ``len``().
3. Used in loops which increase by more than one, standard for loop


#### Details

* Range takes up constant space.
* ``xrange`` in py2 ≡ ``range`` in py3


Note: range is not a generator.
