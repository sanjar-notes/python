# 2. Inter Dict interactions
Created Wednesday 13 May 2020


1. The constructor
	1. Pass a dictionary(copy or literal)
	2. Pass a list of valid 2-tuples
2. update() method - d1.update(d2), adds the kv pairs from d2 to d1. Return **None**.
3. **.copy**() - context independent copy constructor. **Only for mutable iterables.**
4. We can have dicts inside dicts, yes, obviously - **dicts **can be values but not keys.


**Python is made for behavior of strings, not their exact type.**
