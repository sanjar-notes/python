# 1. Write
Created Thursday 14 May 2020

e.g writing 1 to 16 to a binary file and reading them back
	with open('bin', 'bw') as f:
		for i in range(17):
			bin_file.write(bytes([i])) # better is bin_file.write(bytes(range(17))
	with open('bin', 'br') as f:
		for b in binfile:
			print(b)	# read is the same.


1. We use **.write()** because binary files have no concept of lines, i.e print() cannot be used.
2. Bytify the data before writing, using **bytes(list_of_primitives) **- returns a bytes object - an immutable version of a byte array.
	1. If given an integer k, we have k zeros written to the file. 
	2. If we give a list of integers, then their respective hex values are written. Elements of the list must be between** 0 **and** 255** (incl).
	3. We can write any numeric values using *integer_variable***.to_bytes**(*length, byte_order*) - writes the integer.
		1. length can be 1 or more, use powers of two. Ensure it is sufficient.
		2. byte_order specifies little_endian or big_endian(like paper).

	a = 23
	b = 6553
	c = 65534
	d = 65536
	with open('file.txt', 'wb') as bf:
		bf.write(a.to_bytes(1, 'big'))	# for literals, (1).to_bytes(1, 'big') is the way to go.
		bf.write(b.to_bytes(2, 'big'))
		bf.write(c.to_bytes(2, 'little'))
		bf.write(d.to_bytes(3, 'big'))
