Created Thursday 14 May 2020

We'll look at a problem  where we can increase the performance.
[[../shelf_challenge_2.py]]
[[../sc_cave_intilaize.py]]
[[../sc_2_cave_game.py]]

Conclusions: 
* It is very easy to change all dicts to persistent ones. We can now work with real world data.
* Get the data correct first, not changing the code.
