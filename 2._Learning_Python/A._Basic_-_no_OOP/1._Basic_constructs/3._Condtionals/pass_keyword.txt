====== pass keyword ======
Created Wednesday 03 February 2021

* ''pass'' is equivalent to {} in C like languages. It is strictly cosmetic and does not change flow of the program: like break, continue, return do.
* It is used to specify "do nothing" for an otherwise mandatory indented clause.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
if x==2:
	pass # 

def f():
	pass
}}}

* Because it is cosmetic, it is ignored if some actual code is present.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
def g():
	pass
	print('Hello')
# This is OK, Hello is printed
}}}
