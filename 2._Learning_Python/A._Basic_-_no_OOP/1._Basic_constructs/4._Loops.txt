====== 4. Loops ======
Created Wednesday 03 February 2021

**Loops:**
* **for **- used for both ranges and iterables
	* **range**(a, b, step) similar to (i = a; i < b; i++) a = 0, step = 1 is the default 
	* iterables - for item in [1,2,3]
* **while** - standard
* **do while** - standard
* Python3 has no **switch** statement

**Loop controls**
* **continue** - goes to th next iteration without executing anything after continue
* **break **- terminates the innermost rule in which it is present.

**Alternative uses of ''else''**
**mAid** - Else clause runs if flow is not forced explicitly happens - like break
* In **for **loop - executed only if loop runs successfully. It is kind of a misnomer. Helps in avoiding flag variables.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
for i in range(10):
	a = i
else
	print("Loop Ran Okay")
}}}

* In **while** loop - runs if no breaks are executed in the connected while loop
* In error handling - when no error occurs
