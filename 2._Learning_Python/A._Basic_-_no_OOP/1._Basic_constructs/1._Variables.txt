====== 1. Variables ======
Created Saturday 17 October 2020

=== Basic ===
* Variables are an easy way to refer to memory locations and store data.
* Everything is an object in Python.
* Python is dynamically typed(no need to specify type anywhere). Declarations and initalizations are done at the same time.
* Has an automatic garbage-collector(no manual memory management required).

=== Naming rules ===
Same as C++
* Symbols allowed - lowercase and uppercase english alphabets, digits(0-9) and the underscore(_).
* Names cannot start with a digit

**Basic Ops**
* int(str, radix) returns the integer value.
FIXME
There are 3 kinds of variables in python:
1. Global variables
2. Function Variables
3. Class variables
