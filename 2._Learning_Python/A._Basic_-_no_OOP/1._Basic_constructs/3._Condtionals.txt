====== 3. Condtionals ======
Created Thursday 14 January 2021

=== Truthy values ===
* Python has the concept of truthy and falsy values.
* There are 8 fairly obvious falsy values:
	1. int 0
	2. float 0.0
	3. complex - 0j
	4. sting ""
	5. list []
	6. tuple ()
	7. set {}
	8. None.
* Everything else is truthy.
* ShortCircuiting exists for logical operators.

=== Conditionals ===
* General form(regex) â†’ ''if'' ''elif*'' ''else?''. In other words, 4 variations are possible:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
if condition:
	# code
}}}

{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
if condition:
	# code
	
else:
	# code
}}}

{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
if condition:
	# code
	
elif condition2:
	# code
elif condition3:
# many times

# no else
}}}

{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
if condition:
	# code

elif condition2:
	# code
elif condition3:
	# code
	
else:
	# no else
}}}

Note: This is a syntax demonstration, you can't have empty blocks in Python. If you want to "do nothing", use ''pass'' keyword. Like so:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
if condition:
	pass
elif:
	pass
else:
	pass
}}}


=== Switch ===
Python doesn't have this feature.
