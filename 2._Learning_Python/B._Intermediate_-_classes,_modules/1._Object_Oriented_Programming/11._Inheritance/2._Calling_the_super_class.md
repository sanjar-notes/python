# 2. Calling the super class
Created Thursday 28 May 2020


0. If we don't have a function in the childClass, then the function is available, likewise the constructor is called for the base class. [Empty Childclass](./inheritance_code/enemy1.py) 
1. When we made an init method for the troll class, the init method of the Enemy is no longer accessible, it is **shadowed**. This is very different from C++. [shadowing_demo](./inheritance_code/enemy2.py) We see that 'Enemy constructor is no longer accessed'. 
2. We can still access the super class methods by doing Enemy.() [superclass_methods .](./inheritance_code/enemy3.py) This also ensures that there's a single **self**.
3. In python3, we can access the super method using the **super()**. [super() way of accessing base attributes](./inheritance_code/enemy_4_super.py) 

	super().base_method()	# use this
	super(currentClass, self).base_method() # same as line 1


4. Creating a Vampire class


Example of how inheritance handles this: 

1. We don't need to keep track of each object, it is taken care of by the compiler.
2. Coding effort is reduced, it has become natural now.
