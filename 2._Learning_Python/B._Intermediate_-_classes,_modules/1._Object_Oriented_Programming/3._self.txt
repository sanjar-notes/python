====== 3. self ======
Created Friday 22 May 2020

Some conventions:
1. Single line between methods.(PEP8)
2. Two lines between function in a module.(PEP8)
3. Two line between classes.(Personal preference)
--------------------
* All class methods have a **self** attribute, this is compulsory: To distinguish it from the static methods. 
* self could be named anything, but self is very well established, may not work for some software.
* **self** is a reference to the instance variables of a class, analogous to **this** in C++.
* There's no need to provide self when calling methods/accessing attributes.
* We can use the self argument during call, when using the class name directly.
