# 6. pip, environments etc
Created Tuesday 20 October 2020

Why is this important - System python versions should never be touched. Use version management tools for development.

Python management tools:

1. **[pyenv](https://pycon.switowski.com/02-packages/pyenv/)** - for Python version management. Supports global change,local directories, or even current shell. pip packages stay within their Python versions. Bash extension. For windows use pyenv-win package.
2. **virtualenv** - create completely isolated python environments(Python version can be set) for each project. It is used to separate dependencies as well as avoid pollution of the pip global namespace.
3. **pipx** - different instances of the same packages across environments, if pipx deletes a package, it is deleted from all environments.
