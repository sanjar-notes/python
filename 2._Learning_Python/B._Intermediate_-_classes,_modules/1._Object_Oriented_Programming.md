# 1. Object Oriented Programming
Created Friday 22 May 2020


* Different paradigms are not exclusive.
* Imperative: Steps given one by one. Friction, heat, spark, fire.
* OOP: Steps are abstracted. Self lighting matches. Interfacing is great.



* Obviously, there's no MAGIC involved, we have still program the steps, the **good thing** is that the end user doesn't have to **worry** about the details.
* Everything in python **is an object**, but being cognizant of this is **not **a requirement. **Everything**. All data types are a class, and all created classes are also user-built data types.


Jargon:

1. Functions and methods are written the same way, but are slightly different.
2. Attribute - refers to **both **the data members and member functions.
3. The data inside a class in python are called **data attributes**.
4. **Instance **of a class is aka as object of a class.
5. **self **is equivalent to **this **pointer in C++.
6. Dot notation is used to access the class attributes/methods.
	1. Inside the class, we use: **self**.data_attribute_name and **self**.method_name
	2. Outside the class, there are two ways for a **method**, both are equivalent:
		1. object_name.method_name()
		2. ClassName.method_name(object_name)
	3. static attributes are accessed using: ClassName.attribute_name.
