Learning:

1. When the title is unspecified, it is set to None, due to our insistence that it should be None, we did this to allow for copying titles, if they exist elsewhere in the code. Better than giving strings, and making them from scratch, everytime.
2. The None goes all the way to the Htmldoc, and the **str, **eventually makes it into 'None', but this is undesirable, as we want it to be set to Untitled page. The question is: Where to check for title being None and make a Title object with 'Untitled Page'?

Answer: I think it's best to set it in the Title Class itself, because:

1. We'll go through it for sure.
2. If we do it before reaching the title, we'd have to change the code in Title too, i.e check if string is 'Untitled Page', Not suitable.
3. If we do it after the Title, i.e in the Tag, it'd be vague  - we'd be checking for a special case in the base class - this obfuscates the code.
4. Hence We keep the consistency constraints in the class itself. Not it's aggregate/super classes.
