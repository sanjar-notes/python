# 2. Operators
Created Thursday 14 January 2021

#### Arithmetic

* ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``(divide - returns a float)
* Floored division - a``//``b - *same** as floor.
* Remainer - a``%``b(remainder of a when divided by b) - strictly mathematical.( |a%b| < b)
* exponentiation - a``**``b is the same as a^b^, works for all numerical types including complex numbers.



* BODMAS is followed for precedence, same as C++
* Associativity same as C++


#### Relational

1. ``==`` equality
2. ``!=`` in equality
3. ``>``, ``>=`` and all *sensible* variations.


#### Logical

1. ``and`` (logical AND i.e conjunction)
2. ``or`` (logical OR or disjunction)
3. ``not`` (logical NOT or inverse) - can be used as not of whole or not in



* There's no *logical* XOR in python, but ``a!=b`` is a clever equivalent.
* Operators can be chained:
	* a < 2 < c
	* (a and b)
* ``!`` is not an operator by itself in python.


#### Bitwise operators
Python follows 2's complement notation - standard.

* ``>>`` - right shift. Sign is preserved
* ``<<`` - left shift. 0's are padded
