# 2. String formatting
Created Saturday 17 October 2020

#### Method 1 - f strings (modern)
TODO fstrings

#### Method 2 - String Replacement Fields(still in use)

0. Syntax - '`` {0} something'.format(obj)``

1.use ``{idx}`` refers format()
	>>> print("I am a {0}".format("Boy", "Girl"))
	I am a Boy

if we don't use k, python assumes k from 0 to last - It works with classes too, i.e {.field} is OK.

2. We can have multiple and duplicate replacement fields, and they can be out of order as well.
3. For floating point numbers

e.g print("{0:a.b}".format(22/7))
a = total length(both fract as well as non fract) including the '.' (optional)
b = fract length (after the .)

4. For printing a number in binary, hex or oct, we just write {0:b} or {0:o} or {0:x}
5. We can use [] or . notation inside a {}

	'{[2]}'.format([1,2,3]) # -> '3'
	'{.name}'.format(object) # -> 'object.name_value'


* We can write {index: filler align leng num_sys dot_fract_length f} :FALNFf

**MAID** two sections with 3 on both sides - everything is optional on the second section
Left - filler, align, length
Right - num_sys, dot_fract_length, f
e.g print("{0:>06b}".format(9)) is 001001
e.g print("{0:>06.2f}".format(22 / 7)) is 0003.1

* Don't use binary and decimal at the same time

#print('{0:.2f}'.format(123.234))

#### Method 3 - **String formatting (using %)**

1. Using str(), to convert a data type using + and strings, we should use str()
2. We can avoid +, by simply using print(var1, var2, sep = "")
3. We can write a paragraph(string) and describe it in different lines by using triple quotes, instead of single quotes

Note: Don't have 4 quotes in a row. i.e """abc"d" """
Use point 3 to avoid /'s as """ or single doesn't have any problems with using " inside as many times as we wish.

4. We can get input like **cin**, actually better using input.split(), this returns a list of strings of the inputs, Enter <- is the end.

e.g input().split(), 1 2 3, returns ['1', '2', '3']
	a, b, c = map(int, input().split()) # a = 1, b=2, c=3 for input 1 2 3
