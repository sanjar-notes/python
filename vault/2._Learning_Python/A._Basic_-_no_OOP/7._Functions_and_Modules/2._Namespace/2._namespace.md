# 2. namespace
Created Wednesday 06 January 2021

A namespace is a collection of names. 


* It is always associated with some region of code. It is not a physical region.
* Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated.
* These different namespaces are isolated. Hence, the same name that may exist in different modules do not collide.


#### Good to know

* A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long as the interpreter runs.
* Each module creates its own namespace during import.


#### Types of namespaces
There are 4 types of namespaces, in order of lookup:

1. Local - function/class
2. Enclosing - inner function

Global - obvious

4. Built-In - hackable, you can override ``print`` function.
