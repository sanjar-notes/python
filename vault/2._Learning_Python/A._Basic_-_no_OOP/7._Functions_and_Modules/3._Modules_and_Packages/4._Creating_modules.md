# 4. Creating modules
Created Tuesday 12 January 2021


* Modules are just Python files. That‚Äôs it! No special syntax, no 'export' or shebangs are necessary.


#### Executing a module as a script

* All modules are python files: they don't have to be dumb(in-active). 
* We know that modules are executed on import.
* But sometimes, we want to use a runnable script as a module, and would want to execute the active code(that runs) in it - we want to just reuse functions and classes. This is achieved by specifying to Python as to if the script is running alone or is running as a module, which is done by putting all active code in an if statement.

	# classes, functions, variables - non-active reusable code
	if __name__=='__main__':
		# active code here


* When this file is imported the ``__name__`` attribute is not main, because the file is not running in standalone mode, and the active code is skipped. See [this](../1._Functions/3._Functions_in_modules.md)


#### Executing a module as a module üôÉÔ∏è
	python3 -m myFile.py # __name__ is set to fileName(without the .py)
