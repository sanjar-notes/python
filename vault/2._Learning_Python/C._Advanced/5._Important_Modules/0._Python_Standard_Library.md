# 0. Python Standard Library
Created Tuesday 12 January 2021

It is a package that ships with Python, and includes many useful modules - some of them are included automatically(``__builtins__``), whilst others need to be included(imported) explicitly(like shelve, random, pickle).

* There are **many more** things other than from ``__builtins__`` that are included automatically.
