====== 1. Pickling Protocols ======
Created Thursday 14 May 2020

1. There are some objects which cannot be pickled, but they are very less.
2. Pickling protocols are not necessarily backwards compatible.
3. we can specify the **protocol=version_number** in dump() alone, it's not required for load.
* Protocol 0 was somewhat human readable. Delimiter was L. Readable by all.
* Protocol 1 is the first binary protocol, it is forward compatible with any protocol.
* Protocol 2(Python 2) was efficient but is **insecure**.
* Protocol 3(Python3) was the first python3 protocol and is the **default **protocol. Protocol 3 is readable by all the Python3 protocols. It cannot be read by Python2, though.
* We can use different protocols in the same file too, we **don't **need to specify the protocol while reading. **This is not the case with binary files, where **//length//** and **//byte-order//** need to be specified.**
* pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL returns the highest protocol available on the system.
* pickling can wreak havoc if there are "rm" or "del" in the .**loads **(read loads)

os.system() being in the stream caused the action.
This deleted a file !!
