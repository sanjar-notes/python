====== 1. Working with text files ======
Created Wednesday 13 May 2020

Reading is very easy.
1. open('path/file_name', mode) - it'll be created if nonexistent.
	a. path can be relative(. and ..) or absolute. Just write file name if we are in the same directory.
	b. File will be created, only in **w **mode.
	c. Modes are discussed ahead.
2. reading - check file.readable() == True
	a. readline() - line by line, one line as a string at a time
	b. readlines()  - returns a list of lines as strings
	c. read() - returns the whole file as a string
3. closing the file using f.close(), where f is the file variable.
--------------------
* Pythonic way of reading - we can iterate over the lines, rather than writing a while loop. All content behaves as if it were in a list.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
f = open('file.ext', 'r')
for line in f:
	print(line, end='') # this is important, as we already have a \n at end of each line
f.close()
}}}

* There's a fail-proof method for reading files - using **with **keyword, this tidies up the object after execution. Files support this. **with **also returns an exception if an **error occurs. **This is called a context Manager.
This helps us release the file once we are done working on it:
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
with open('file.ext', 'r') as f: # same syntax as import
	for line in f:
		print(line, end='')
# no need to close the file
}}}
