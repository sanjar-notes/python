====== 1. Read functions ======
Created Wednesday 13 May 2020

1. **.readline()** returns the current line string, line pointer advances by 1.
2. **.readlines() **returns a list of all the lines. We can see '\n' at the end of each element. Useful for debugging.
3. **.read() **returns the whole file as a single string. Same as ''.join(f.readlines()). It also **advances **file pointer to the EOF.

Note: 
1. We **cannot** print the file object directly. Because it is much more than mere contents. Also that'd make us keep the whole file in memory.
2. read can also take the param on how much to read, similar to head.


--------------------
**READING WITH SENSE**
1. We are given a file which has some known data type, example tuples. To read this data as tuples, we'd have to write a program and use our knowledge of tuples. Instead, we can use **eval() **function which automatically deduces the type here.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
f = open('in.txt','r')	# has (1, 2) stored
contents = f.readline() # we've got the string ^(1, 2)$
data = eval(contents) # catches that the string is actually a tuple
data[0]=2 # throws an error that tuples are immutable - demonstrates successful capture of tuple
}}}

eval() evaluates any string passed to **it as legitimate parts** of the programs.
**Note:**  eval() is not a good thing, coz it can be source of problems. Obviously. There are better ways to do it. As it could write/corrupt the file and/or have damaging unintended instructions while reading.
