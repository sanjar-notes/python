====== 2. namespace ======
Created Wednesday 06 January 2021

A namespace is a collection of names. 

* It is always associated with some region of code. It is not a physical region.
* Different namespaces can co-exist at a given time but are completely isolated.
* These different namespaces are isolated. Hence, the same name that may exist in different modules do not collide.

=== Good to know ===
* A namespace containing all the built-in names is created when we start the Python interpreter and exists as long as the interpreter runs.
* Each module creates its own namespace during import.

=== Types of namespaces ===
There are 4 types of namespaces:
1. Built-In
2. Global
3. Enclosing
4. Local
