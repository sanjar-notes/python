====== 5. Accessing namespaces ======
Created Wednesday 06 January 2021

Namespaces are implemented as dictionaries.
They can be accesses by the functions:
1. ''locals''() - returns a //copy// of the local namespace dictionary.
2. ''globals''() - returns the global namespace dictionary.
* There's nothing like 'nonlocals()', because blockscopes don't exist in Python. Although a keyword called 'nonlocal' does exist, it's for obtaining write access to outer an function.
* You should not mess with any of these 'methods'. 
* Using ''global'' or ''nonlocal'' for write access is a different thing altogether.
