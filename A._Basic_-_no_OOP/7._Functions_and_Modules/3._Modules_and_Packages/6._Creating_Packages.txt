====== 6. Creating Packages ======
Created Tuesday 12 January 2021

[[3. Modules and Packages|What are packages?]]
The most basic use of ''__init__.py'' is to mark a directory as a python package.

=== Importing packages, and modules inside ===
* The syntax is exactly the same as modules - ''from'' for selective, ''import'', ''as'' for alias.
* Importing a package(without specifying a module) just imports(executes) the packageâ€™s ''__init__.py'' file as a module, if it's available.
{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
import pkg # just runs __init__.py if available
pkg.mod1 # Error, not specified in import

from pkg import *
pkg.mod1 # still an error
}}}

* There's a caveat for asterisk - it does not import all modules. Mentioned in this page.

=== Package initialization ===
* This is nothing fancy.
* The ''__init__.py'' file is executed.
* This is done for each package(directory) that we enter.

=== What to write inside ''__init__.py'' ===
* It can be empty.
* You can initialize package level data or import modules.
* You can specify the ''__all__'' variable(list of strings) which controls asterisk(for all) behavior exhibited by the package.

=== Importing * from package ===
Consider the following structure
{{./pasted_image001.png}}

{{{code: lang="python3" linenumbers="True"
# just outside the pkg directory, in a file
# we have this code
from pkg import *
pkg.mod1 # error
}}}

* It is natural to expect that because modules and packages use the same syntax, asterisk will import all the modules inside the package - **Python does not do this.**
* Instead Python imports only those which are listed in the ''__all__'' in ''__init__.py'' which is a list of module names(strings).
* Having the ''__all__'' isn't necessary, although is useful.
* Python has the ''__all__'' to give the package author to decide behavior of the package.

Note:
* If you have a bunch of modules in a folder. You can use them without making the folder a package, i.e ''__init__'' is not compulsory.
