====== 1. Module Search Path ======
Created Tuesday 12 January 2021

Modules are accessed by importing them, using the ''import'' keyword.

When the interpreter executes an ''import'' statement, it searches the in the //in-built modules **first**//. If not found, it looks at ''sys.path'' which is initalized based on these sources:
1. Current directory - location where the interpreter was started, may not be the place where the top-level script is present.
2. PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, copy of the terminal shell variable called PATH).
3. An installation-dependent list of directories configured at the time Python is installed. This contains modules installed using pip.

=== Note ===
* Builtins cannot be be impersonated - as inbuilts are searched first, the search will stop as soon as the standard module is found, i.e you'll never reach the fake standard module.
* 3rd party modules can be impersonated, I mean overshadowed, because Python searches the current directory before searching 3rd party.

=== Important ===
* It is clear that Python does not track the directory of any script based on ''os.curdir'' - it is just the location of where interpreter is currently.
Then how does python work with files? See pages ahead.
